        400 code can be returned in the following specified cases, the
        specific cause has to be proper specified in the "ProblemDetails"
        structure to be returned.

        If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
        request URI contains incorrect query parameters or the payload body
        contains a syntactically incorrect data structure), the API producer
        shall respond with this response code. The "ProblemDetails"
        structure shall be provided, and should include in the "detail"
        attribute more information about the source of the problem.

        If the response to a GET request which queries a container resource
        would be so big that the performance of the API producer is
        adversely affected, and the API producer does not support paging for
        the affected resource, it shall respond with this response code. The
        "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and should include in
        the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
        problem.

        If there is an application error related to the client's input that
        cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
        error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code. The
        "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
        the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
        problem.

        If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
        should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
        returned in the WWW Authenticate HTTP header. 
        The ProblemDetails structure may be provided.

        The use of this HTTP error response code described above is
        applicable to the use of the OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of API
        requests and notifications.

            These attributes represent values that are stored persistently
            in the AsInstance structure for  consumption by the CNFM or
            the lifecycle management scripts during the execution of AS
            lifecycle  management operations. 

            All extensions that are allowed for the AS are declared in
            the ASD. The declaration of an extension  in the ASD
            contains information on whether its presence is optional or
            required, and optionally can  specify an initial value. See
            notes 2 and 4. The CNFM shall reject requests to write
            extension attributes  that are not declared in the ASD with a
            "422 Unprocessable entity" error response as defined in
            clause  6.4 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 013.

            Modifying the values of these attributes has no direct effect
            on the AS instance; however, the modified  attribute values
            can be considered during subsequent AS lifecycle management
            operations, which means that  the modified values can
            indirectly affect the configuration of the AS instance.

            These attributes can be initialized with default values from
            the ASD (see note 4).

            These attributes can be modified with values passed in the
            request structures of certain LCM operations,  such as the
            InstantiateAsRequest structure.

            Further, these attributes can be created, modified or deleted
            with the PATCH method.

            In addition, the provisions in clause 5.7 shall apply.
